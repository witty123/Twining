                 random sampling based on the sample size and plots the distribution on the right hand section. For each distribution function, 
                 the mathematical representation of the function is presented in the top of the plot on the right side, along with the mean and 
                 standard deviation of the distribution. If the distribution is continuous, you can also plot the density curve on the plot. 
                 Each distribution comes with a set of parameters which you can tweak and tinker with based on the function and if you wish to,
